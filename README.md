### Overview
The NBA MVP Predictor is a Python-based project that utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the NBA for a given season. The project involves web scraping data from basketballreference.com, cleaning and exploring the dataset, and then employing ridge regression and random forest regression models for prediction.

### Features
Web scraping using Beautiful Soup to gather information about past NBA MVPs from basketballreference.com.
Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand and preprocess the dataset.
Ridge regression and random forest regression models for predicting the NBA MVP.
Randomized search for hyperparameter tuning in the regression models.
Backtesting on previous years to evaluate the predictive performance of the models.
